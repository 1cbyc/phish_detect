# phish_detect

i intend to use nlp to analyze URLs, email content, and webpage features to determine if a link or message is a phishing attempt. i might also build a classification model using labeled data from phishing and legitimate sites that i will gather too.


i am thinking on the website where people would do phishing websites search, i will probably add a counter to show how many searches has been found.
